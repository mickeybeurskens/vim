# Vim Config

My vim configuration files.

Clone to home directory in `.vim`, simlink `~/.vim/vimrc` to `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` (for neovim) and you are good to go!

If you are using Pycharm and IdeaVim you can also simlink `~/.vim/vimrc` to `~/.ideavimrc` to get the same configurations in your IDE.
